# mini-pipelines
**A collection of scripts that chain together other scripts by preparing and then processing/transforming the data. A.K.A `sheperding scripts`, `utility sctips`, `parent scripts`, `shepards`, `control scripts`, `chained scripts`, `linked scripts`, `script uniters`, `processors`, `conveyance scripts`, `mini-workflows`, `script managers`, `workflow faciliators`, `workflow aides`,`scripted workflows`,`scripted data handlers`.**&ast;  
The repository will probably be mainly Python scripts, but could include some shell/Bash ones too. The inaugral scripts that went into this repository were Python and used Python to control things at the command line level as well.  
&ast;In naming this repository, I based it on the responses of stevegt and Alastair Kerr as posted [here](https://www.biostars.org/p/17696/).
