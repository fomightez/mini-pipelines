# mini-pipelines
**A collection of scripts that chain together other scripts by preparing and then processing/transforming the data. A.K.A `sheperds`, `control scripts`, `script uniters`, `processors`, `conveyance scripts` `mini-workflows`, `script managers`, `workflow faciliators`, `workflow aides`.**&ast;  
The repository will probably be mainly Python scripts, but could include some shell/Bash ones too. The inaugral scripts that went into this repository were Python and used Python to control things at the command line level as well.  
&ast;In naming the repository, I went with the responses of stevegt and Alastair Kerr as posted [here](https://www.biostars.org/p/17696/).
